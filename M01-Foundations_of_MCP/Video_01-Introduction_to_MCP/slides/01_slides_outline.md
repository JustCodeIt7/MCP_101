# What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

* An open standard protocol for AI context management
* Allows AI systems to connect to external tools and data sources
* Think of it as a "USB-C for AI" - a universal connector
* Created to solve the integration complexity in AI applications

---

# The Problem MCP Solves

* The "M × N Integration Problem":
  * M different AI models
  * N different tools and data sources
  * Without standardization: M × N custom integrations needed
  * With MCP: Only M + N implementations (each model and tool implements MCP once)

# Key Components of MCP

1. **MCP Servers**: Expose capabilities to AI models
2. **MCP Clients**: Connect AI applications to servers
3. **Context Management**: Standardized data exchange

---

# MCP Server Components

* **Tools**: Functions that AI models can call to perform actions
  * Example: Web search, calculator, sending emails
* **Resources**: Data that AI models can access
  * Example: User preferences, document content
* **Prompts**: Templates that guide interaction patterns
  * Example: Standardized formats for code review

# MCP in the AI Ecosystem

* Bridges the gap between:
  * AI models: Claude, GPT, Llama, etc.
  * External systems: APIs, databases, file systems, web services
* Reduces integration complexity
* Enables richer AI applications with real-world context

---

# Real-World MCP Applications

* AI assistants accessing personalized user information
* Coding assistants interacting with development environments
* AI agents performing actions in software applications
* LLMs retrieving real-time data (weather, stocks, news)
* Multi-step workflows involving multiple tools and data sources

# Benefits of Adopting MCP

1. **Standardization**: Build once, connect to many AI models
2. **Interoperability**: Mix and match tools and models
3. **Modular Design**: Separate concerns of AI models and tools
4. **Security**: Controlled access to external systems
5. **Ecosystem**: Growing library of pre-built MCP servers
