# --- Configuration ---
# Basic configuration for our server
SERVER_HOST = '127.0.0.1' # Localhost
SERVER_PORT = 8765        # A port number for the server to listen on
LOG_LEVEL = logging.INFO  # Set logging level (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR)

# --- Logging Setup ---
logging.basicConfig(level=LOG_LEVEL, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# --- Define Server Logic (Request Handlers) ---
# MCP servers typically handle specific types of requests or commands.
# We define functions to handle these. The MCP library might use decorators
# or another mechanism to register these handlers.

# This is a placeholder handler function.
# The actual signature (arguments, return type) depends on the specific MCP library.
# Assume the library routes requests based on a 'command' field in the request.

    # It might take host, port, and handlers directly, or load from a config file.

        # Example: Pass configuration and handlers during initialization
        server = mcp.Server(

            # handlers={"ping": handle_ping_request, "get_context": handle_get_context_request}
        )

        # --- Register Handlers (if needed) ---
        # If handlers aren't passed in init, register them now.
        # The decorator approach is common in web frameworks, MCP might use something similar.
        # Example using a hypothetical registration method:
        server.register_handler("ping", handle_ping_request)
        server.register_handler("get_context", handle_get_context_request)
