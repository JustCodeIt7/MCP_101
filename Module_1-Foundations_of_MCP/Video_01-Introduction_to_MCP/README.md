# Video 1: Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Title: What is MCP? A Beginner's Guide for AI Developers

### Overview
This introductory video provides a conceptual understanding of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), explaining its purpose, key components, and real-world applications.

### Learning Objectives
1. Understand what MCP is and why it's important for AI development
2. Learn the key components of MCP: servers, clients, and context management
3. Explore real-world use cases and applications of MCP

### Key Concepts Covered
- Overview of the MCP framework and its architecture
- How MCP fits into AI/ML workflows as a standardized interface
- The "M x N problem" that MCP solves in AI integration
- Real-world examples of MCP applications

### Content Structure
1. Introduction to MCP as a standardized protocol for AI
2. The problem MCP solves (integration complexity)
3. MCP architecture: Servers, Clients, and Context
4. Core MCP primitives: Tools, Resources, and Prompts
5. Real-world applications and use cases
6. Benefits of adopting MCP

### Code Examples
The `code/01_mcp_intro_concept.py` file provides a conceptual illustration of MCP components, but does not contain functional implementation (as this is a conceptual introduction).

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts
- No specific MCP knowledge required

### Follow-up Videos
The next video will dive deeper into MCP architecture and core concepts, explaining the client-server model and communication protocols in detail.
