Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)
-------------------------------------------
This script illustrates the basic concept of MCP with simplified examples.
This is intended for educational purposes to explain the key components
and interactions in MCP, rather than being functional code.

# ========================================================================
# WHAT IS MCP?
# ========================================================================
# Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI models
# and applications to connect to external tools and data sources.
# Think of it as a "USB-C for AI" - a standardized way for AI models
# to interact with the world around them.

# Import the MCP library (simplified for illustration)
import mcp  # In reality, you would use: from mcp import FastMCP, ClientSession

# ========================================================================
# KEY COMPONENTS OF MCP
# ========================================================================

# === 1. MCP SERVERS ===
# Servers expose capabilities (tools) and data (resources) that AI models can use

def create_simple_mcp_server():
    """
    Conceptual example of creating an MCP server
    An MCP server exposes:
    - Tools: Functions the AI can execute (e.g., search the web, calculate math)
    - Resources: Data the AI can access (e.g., retrieve user preferences)
    - Prompts: Templates for interaction patterns

    # def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    #     """Add two numbers together."""
    #     return a + b

# === 2. MCP CLIENTS ===
# Clients connect to MCP servers to use their capabilities

def create_simple_mcp_client():
    """
    Conceptual example of creating an MCP client

    - Connects to MCP servers

    - Allows the AI model to use these capabilities

# === 3. CONTEXT MANAGEMENT ===
# MCP provides standardized ways to manage context between AI models and external systems

    Illustrates how MCP manages context
    Context includes:
    - Information needed for tools to function
    - Data retrieved from resources
    - State maintained across interactions

    model_input = "What's the weather like in my city?"
    
    # Without MCP: Model might hallucinate or say it doesn't know user's location
    
    # With MCP: Model can retrieve user's location through a standardized interface
